# sjsuparking4me

## Description
This is a personal project by Ian Chavez, CS major at San Jose State University. The goal of this project is to create a web application that will allow users to view parking availability in real time.

This will pull from the SJSU Parking Status website (link: https://sjsuparkingstatus.sjsu.edu/) and display the information in a more user friendly way with additional functionality of estimating potential parking at a the user's given input time.
