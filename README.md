# sjsuparking4me

## Description
This is a personal project by Ian Chavez, CS major at San Jose State University. The goal of this project is to create a web application that will allow users to view parking availability in real time.

This will pull from the SJSU Parking Status website (link: https://sjsuparkingstatus.sjsu.edu/) and display the information in a more user friendly way with additional functionality of estimating potential parking at a the user's given input time.

---------------------------------------
Plan of 9/15/2021:

Pull current % of parking availability from SJSU Parking Status website (https://sjsuparkingstatus.sjsu.edu) and store it in a database. From real experience, the website seems to update every 4 minutes after refreshing.

Store data per each garage (North, West, South, South Campus). Potentially use a dictionary to store the data? (key: garage name, value: % availability)
